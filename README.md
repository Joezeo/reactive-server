# reactive_server

This project is a reactive web server template, using webflux + reactive-mongo as basic framework, a template for efficiently dealing with highly concurrent requests.  

Servers bases on this template from my own have `7000+` throughput under `10000+` concurrency with `1s` response time in average via pressure test by Jmeter.
